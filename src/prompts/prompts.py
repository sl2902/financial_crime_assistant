# used in the retriever.py module
# decide on tool use based on end user query
router_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a tool router. Decide which tool(s) to use for the query.

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
- search_sec_documents: Search SEC case documents for details, penalties, allegations, summaries
- search_knowledge_graph: Query entity relationships, networks, who worked with whom, co-defendants
- tavily_search: Search recent news and current events (last 6 months)

ROUTING RULES:

Use search_knowledge_graph when query asks:
- "who" questions (who was charged, who worked at, who are the defendants)
- "which" questions (which companies, which people)
- "list" or "show" requests (list all defendants, show connections)
- relationships or networks (worked together, co-defendants, affiliated with)

Use search_sec_documents when query asks:
- "what happened" (case details, summaries)
- specific information (penalties, amounts, allegations, outcomes)
- "tell me about" or "describe" (narrative information)
- historical enforcement data and trends

Use tavily_search when query mentions:
- "recent", "latest", "current", "this week/month"
- breaking news or ongoing events
- developments after 2024

Use MULTIPLE tools when query needs:
- Comparisons (historical vs recent → SEC + tavily)
- Comprehensive answers (tell me everything → graph + SEC)
- Both relationships and details (who was involved and what happened → graph + SEC)

CRITICAL:
- Return an EMPTY list [] if the query is conceptual/general (no external data needed)
- Return ONLY valid tool names from the list above
- For "list defendants in ponzi scheme" → use search_knowledge_graph (it's a "list" + "who" question)

Query: {query}

Return tool names as a list.
