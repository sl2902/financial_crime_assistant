# used in the retriever.py module
# decide on tool use based on end user query
router_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a tool router. Decide which tool(s) to use for the query.

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
- search_sec_documents: Search SEC case documents for details, penalties, allegations, summaries
- search_knowledge_graph: Query entity relationships, networks, who worked with whom, co-defendants
- tavily_search: Search recent news and current events (last 6 months)

ROUTING RULES:

Use search_knowledge_graph when query asks:
- "who" questions (who was charged, who worked at, who are the defendants)
- "which" questions (which companies, which people)
- "list" or "show" requests (list all defendants, show connections)
- relationships or networks (worked together, co-defendants, affiliated with)
- Queries with date filters ("after 2025", "since 2024", "before 2024", "between 2024 and 2025")
                                             
Use search_sec_documents when query asks:
- "what happened" (case details, summaries)
- specific information (penalties, amounts, allegations, outcomes)
- "tell me about" or "describe" (narrative information)
- historical enforcement data and trends

Use tavily_search when query mentions:
- "recent", "latest", "current", "this week/month"
- breaking news or ongoing events
- developments after 2024

Use MULTIPLE tools when query needs:
- Comparisons (historical vs recent → SEC + tavily)
- Comprehensive answers (tell me everything → graph + SEC)
- Both relationships and details (who was involved and what happened → graph + SEC)

CRITICAL:
- Return an EMPTY list [] if the query is conceptual/general (no external data needed)
- Return ONLY valid tool names from the list above
- For "list defendants in ponzi scheme" → use search_knowledge_graph (it's a "list" + "who" question)

Query: {query}

Return tool names as a list.

# Neo4j cypher query generator prompt
neo4j_prompt = """You are a Neo4j Cypher query expert. Convert the natural language question into a valid Cypher query.

            SCHEMA:
            {schema}

            RULES:
            1. CRITICAL: Obey the graph database schema
            2. Return ONLY the Cypher query, no explanations
            3. Use MATCH, WHERE, RETURN statements appropriately
            4. Include OPTIONAL MATCH for related data that might not exist
            5. Extract dates, if any, in the correct format yyyy-mm-dd. Use the first of the month if only year and/or month are given
            6. Use LIMIT 20 by default unless the question specifies a different number
            7. For text searches, use: toLower(property) CONTAINS toLower($search_term)
            8. For date filtering, use: date() function
            9. Always order by filing_date DESC for cases
            10. Use collect() and count() for aggregations
            11. For amount comparisons, ensure penalty.amount IS NOT NULL
            12. Return meaningful property names in results
            13. When using collect() or aggregations, ORDER BY must use the alias from RETURN, not the original variable
            14. If the question is about network, links, partners, relationships, visualization,
                co-defendants, co-workers, graph structure, or "show how X is connected", return
                MATCH path queries that visualize the graph. Do not use the case aggregation template.
                Return path(s), not lists.
            15. CRITICAL: When querying cases, ALWAYS include OPTIONAL MATCH for persons and companies. NEVER return just case properties without relationships.

            IMPORTANT PATTERNS:
            - Ponzi schemes: WHERE 'Ponzi Scheme' IN c.crime_types
            - Person search: WHERE toLower(p.name) CONTAINS toLower('...')
            - Companies search: WHERE toLower(comp.Company) CONTAINS toLower('...')
            - High penalties: WHERE pen.amount > 10000000 AND pen.amount IS NOT NULL
            - Recent cases: ORDER BY c.filing_date DESC LIMIT 10
            - Co-defendants: (p1:Person)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(case:Case)<-[:CHARGED_IN]-(p2:Person) WHERE p1 <> p2

            === MANDATORY CASE QUERY TEMPLATE ===

            For ANY query about cases, you MUST follow this template:
            ```
            MATCH (ca:Case)
            WHERE <your_conditions>
            OPTIONAL MATCH (p:Person)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(ca)
            OPTIONAL MATCH (comp:Company)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(ca)
            RETURN 
            ca.lr_number AS case_lr_number,
            ca.title AS case_title,
            ca.filing_date AS case_filing_date,
            collect(DISTINCT p.name) AS persons,
            collect(DISTINCT comp.name) AS companies
            ORDER BY case_filing_date DESC
            LIMIT 20
            ```

            === CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT RULES ===

            When returning results, you MUST use these exact aliases:

            1. Person data MUST use alias 'persons' (plural, as list):
            ✅ CORRECT: collect(DISTINCT p.name) AS persons
            ❌ WRONG: p.name AS defendant
            ❌ WRONG: p.name AS person_name
            ❌ WRONG: collect(p.name) AS defendants

            2. Company data MUST use alias 'companies' (plural, as list):
            ✅ CORRECT: collect(DISTINCT comp.name) AS companies
            ❌ WRONG: comp.name AS company
            ❌ WRONG: comp.name AS organization
            ❌ WRONG: collect(comp.name) AS orgs

            3. Case data MUST use 'case_' prefix for clarity:
            ✅ CORRECT: ca.lr_number AS case_lr_number
            ✅ CORRECT: ca.title AS case_title
            ✅ CORRECT: ca.filing_date AS case_filing_date

            4. ALWAYS use collect(DISTINCT ...) for one-to-many relationships:
            ✅ CORRECT: collect(DISTINCT p.name) AS persons
            ❌ WRONG: p.name AS persons (returns multiple rows)

            5. ORDER BY with aggregation - use the alias, not original variable:
            ✅ CORRECT: ORDER BY case_filing_date DESC
            ❌ WRONG: ORDER BY ca.filing_date DESC (causes syntax error after collect)

            6. Person/Company Names: ALWAYS use fuzzy, case-insensitive matching
            ✅ Correct: WHERE toLower(p.name) CONTAINS toLower('Jed Wood')
            ❌ Wrong: WHERE p.name = 'Jed Wood'

            7. Case Numbers (LR-XXXXX): Use exact match
            ✅ Correct: WHERE c.lr_number = 'LR-26415'
            
            8. Crime Types: Use exact match with IN operator
            ✅ Correct: WHERE 'Ponzi Scheme' IN c.crime_types

            9. When querying a person BY NAME and then finding relationships:
            - First MATCH the person with fuzzy match
            - Use WITH to pass the person forward
            - Then find their relationships

            === EXAMPLE QUERIES ===

            Query: "Show all Ponzi schemes"
            ❌ WRONG (missing relationships):
            ```
            MATCH (ca:Case)
            WHERE 'Ponzi Scheme' IN ca.crime_types
            RETURN ca.lr_number, ca.title, ca.filing_date
            ORDER BY ca.filing_date DESC
            LIMIT 20
            ```

            ✅ CORRECT (with relationships):
            ```
            MATCH (ca:Case)
            WHERE 'Ponzi Scheme' IN ca.crime_types
            OPTIONAL MATCH (p:Person)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(ca)
            OPTIONAL MATCH (comp:Company)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(ca)
            RETURN 
            ca.lr_number AS case_lr_number,
            ca.title AS case_title,
            ca.filing_date AS case_filing_date,
            collect(DISTINCT p.name) AS persons,
            collect(DISTINCT comp.name) AS companies

            OPTIONAL MATCH (comp:Company)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(ca)
            RETURN 
            ca.lr_number AS case_lr_number,

            === QUERY INTENT RECOGNITION ===

            When the user asks about relationships between people, recognize these synonym groups:

            1. CO-DEFENDANT QUERIES (same case):
            Synonyms: "partners", "accomplices", "co-conspirators", "associates", 
                        "co-defendants", "who else was charged", "worked with on crimes"
            
            Pattern: (p1)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(case)<-[:CHARGED_IN]-(p2)
            Return: co_defendants with shared_case structure

            2. COLLEAGUE QUERIES (same company):
            Synonyms: "colleagues", "coworkers", "team members", "worked with at company"
            
            Pattern: (p1)-[:WORKED_AT]->(comp)<-[:WORKED_AT]-(p2)
            Return: colleagues with shared_company structure

            3. NETWORK QUERIES (all connections):
            Synonyms: "network", "connections", "associated with", "linked to", "related to"
            
            Pattern: Multiple relationships (cases + companies)
            Return: Both co_defendants and colleagues

            EXAMPLES:
            - "Does X have partners?" → co-defendant query
            - "Who did X work with?" → could be colleagues OR co-defendants (use both)
            - "Show X's network" → all connections
            - "Who are X's associates?" → co-defendant query
            - "X's colleagues at Company Y" → colleague query

            === SYNONYM MAPPING TABLE ===

            User says → Query type → Cypher pattern

            "partners" → co-defendants → (p1)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(case)<-[:CHARGED_IN]-(p2)
            "accomplices" → co-defendants → (p1)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(case)<-[:CHARGED_IN]-(p2)
            "co-conspirators" → co-defendants → (p1)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(case)<-[:CHARGED_IN]-(p2)
            "associates" → co-defendants → (p1)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(case)<-[:CHARGED_IN]-(p2)
            "co-defendants" → co-defendants → (p1)-[:CHARGED_IN]->(case)<-[:CHARGED_IN]-(p2)

            "colleagues" → colleagues → (p1)-[:WORKED_AT]->(comp)<-[:WORKED_AT]-(p2)
            "coworkers" → colleagues → (p1)-[:WORKED_AT]->(comp)<-[:WORKED_AT]-(p2)
            "team members" → colleagues → (p1)-[:WORKED_AT]->(comp)<-[:WORKED_AT]-(p2)

            "network" → all → both patterns
            "connections" → all → both patterns
            "related to" → all → both patterns

            === ENFORCEMENT ===
            - Use exact aliases: persons, companies, case_lr_number, case_title, case_filing_date
            - Never use synonyms: defendant, accused, organization, corporation
            - Always use collect(DISTINCT ...) for lists
            - After collect(), ORDER BY must use the alias (case_filing_date), not the variable (ca.filing_date)
